# Classifying Risky P2P Loans
### ML-Driven Approach to Risk Management for Unsecured Consumer Debt (P2P Lending)
## Abstract
The prevalence of a global Peer-to-Peer (P2P) economy, coupled with the recent deregulation of financial markets, has lead to the widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence driven by FinTech firms to manage risk when speculating on unsecured P2P debt obligations. After meticulously identifying ‘debt belonging to high-risk individuals’ by leveraging an ensemble of Machine Learning algorithms, these firms are able to find ideal trading opportunities.

While researching AI-driven portfolio management that favor risk-minimization strategies by unmasking subtle interactions amongst high dimensional features to identify prospective trades that exhibit modest ,low-risk gains, I was impressed that the overall portfolio: realized a modest return through a numerosity of individual gains; achieved an impressive Sharpe ratio stemming from infrequent losses and minimal portfolio volatility.

## Project Overview
### Objective
Build a binary classification model that predicts the “Charged Off” or “Fully Paid” Status of a loan by analyzing predominant characteristics which differentiate the two classes in order to engineer new features that may better enable our Machine Learning algorithms to reach efficacy in minimizing portfolio risk while observing better-than-average returns. Ultimately, the aim is to deploy this model to assist in placing trades on loans immediately after they are issued by Lending Club.

### About P2P Lending
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending offers borrowers with bad credit to get the necessary funds to meet emergency deadlines. It might seem careless to lend even more money to people who have demonstrated an inability to repay loans in the past. However, by implementing Machine Learning algorithms to classify poor trade prospects, one can effectively minimize portfolio risk.

There is a large social component to P2P lending, for sociological factors (stigma of defaulting) often plays a greater role than financial metrics in determining an applicant’s creditworthiness. For example the “online friendships of borrowers act as signals of credit quality.” ( Lin et all, 2012)

The social benefit of providing finance for another individual has wonderful implications, and, while it is nice to engage in philanthropic activities, the motivating factor for underwriting speculating in p2p lending markets is financial gain, especially since the underlying debt is unsecured and investors
